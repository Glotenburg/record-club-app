# World Music (Term)

World music is a term used broadly to classify musical styles from diverse cultures across the globe, particularly those lying outside the mainstream Western popular music and Western art music traditions.


Originating independently in academic and music industry contexts during the latter half of the 20th century, the term has become both influential and highly contested. Its inherent ambiguity, coupled with its function as a marketing category, has led to significant criticism regarding its vague definition, commercial motivations, and perceived reinforcement of ethnocentrism, cultural homogenization, and exoticism. The term simultaneously operates as an academic concept with idealistic roots, a pragmatic tool for the music industry, and a focal point for critical cultural debate.

## Etymology and Origins


The term "world music" has distinct origins in academia and the commercial music industry, with significantly different initial intentions.

### Academic Coining: Robert E. Brown and Wesleyan University

The term is widely credited to American ethnomusicologist **Robert E. Brown**, who conceived it in the early 1960s at Wesleyan University in Connecticut. Brown was instrumental in developing a comprehensive music program at Wesleyan, offering studies from the undergraduate to the doctoral level.

Brown stated that his primary motivation for coining "world music" was to differentiate his new Ph.D. program from existing ethnomusicology programs. Ethnomusicology, which emerged formally around 1950 from comparative musicology, primarily focused on studying music within its cultural context, often using ethnographic methods. While ethnomusicology aimed to move beyond the Western biases of earlier comparative musicology, Brown envisioned a program with a strong performance orientation. The objective was to teach students to perform music from various global traditions as faithfully as possible. To facilitate this, Brown invited numerous visiting performers from Africa and Asia and initiated a world music concert series at Wesleyan.

Philosophically, Brown's concept of world music was idealistic, anticipating a future global culture where accelerated communication technology would allow all music to potentially belong to everyone. It aimed to view music from diverse cultures from a perspective "beyond culture," while simultaneously recognizing the critical need to preserve the vast diversity of human musical expression. This utopian vision, embodied in the Wesleyan World Music Program, created a vibrant musical environment in the 1960s and began to disseminate the term and the concept of "world music" to a wider public through musical events and performances. Brown's original concept, therefore, was focused on performance, preservation, and a future-oriented global musical landscape, rather than simply categorizing existing non-Western music for study or sale. This idealistic foundation contrasts sharply with the term's later adoption and redefinition by the music industry.



### Popularization as a Marketing Category

While Brown coined the term academically in the 1960s, "world music" gained widespread currency and its most recognized meaning in the 1980s as a marketing category devised by the Western music industry.



#### The 1980s Music Industry Context

The rise of "world music" as a commercial label was largely a response to specific market conditions in the 1980s. A pivotal moment was the release and international success of Paul Simon's album **Graceland** in 1986. The album, which prominently featured South African musicians and musical styles (including Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Savuka), significantly increased the interest of Western audiences in music from other parts of the world, particularly Africa. This success highlighted a growing market for non-Western sounds.

However, record labels and retailers faced a practical problem: how to categorize and display this diverse music. Genres like Nigerian jùjú, Ghanaian highlife, or Pakistani qawwali did not fit neatly into existing sections like "Pop," "Rock," "Jazz," or "Classical." Pre-existing terms like "International," "Ethnic," or "Folk" were considered insufficient, potentially confusing, or carried negative connotations. "International" had limited currency, often associated with tourist souvenirs or academic field recordings. There was a need for a unified, marketable term.



#### The 1987 London Meeting

To address this challenge and capitalize on the growing interest sparked by artists like Simon and the increasing visibility of African musicians like Fela Kuti, Manu Dibango, Hugh Masekela, and Miriam Makeba, a pivotal meeting was held in a London pub on **June 29, 1987**. Initiated by executives from independent record labels such as Roger Armstrong (Ace Records) and Ben Mandelson (GlobeStyle), and attended by key figures in the UK roots and international music scene, including fRoots magazine founder Ian Anderson, the meeting's primary objective was explicitly commercial. They sought an umbrella term to improve the marketing, distribution, and retail visibility of non-Western music.

Several names were suggested, including "world beat" (a term coined separately by DJ Dan Del Santo in Texas around 1983) and prefixing existing genres with words like "hot" or "tropical". Ultimately, **"World Music"** won after a show of hands. Crucially, the term was not initially intended to define a new musical genre itself, but rather to serve as a short-term marketing label for a specific campaign. The logic, articulated by Roger Armstrong, was to create a designated section—a "box" akin to "Jazz" or "Rock"—where retailers could confidently stock these otherwise hard-to-place releases, and where interested customers could browse or find music they might have heard on the radio.



#### Commercial Rollout and Institutionalization


Following the meeting, a coordinated marketing campaign was launched. This included designing distinctive two-color record sleeves with special offers and providing retailers with labels for shelf or rack edging to clearly mark the new "World Music" section. Leafleting campaigns and outreach to DJs, particularly outside London, were key strategies to build awareness and demand.

The term was rapidly adopted by the media and the broader music industry. Its status as a recognized category was solidified through institutionalization. In 1990, the influential US trade magazine **Billboard** introduced a World Music chart. A year later, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), the organization behind the Grammy Awards, added a category for **Best World Music Album**, first awarded in 1992. This pragmatic, market-driven adoption fundamentally shifted the term's meaning away from Robert Brown's academic and philosophical concept towards a retail category defined primarily by the needs and perspectives of the Western music industry. This shift laid the groundwork for many of the subsequent criticisms regarding commercialization, homogenization, and ethnocentrism.

## Definitions and Scope

A central challenge surrounding the term "world music" is its inherent ambiguity and the lack of a single, universally accepted definition. Its meaning has shifted over time and varies depending on context and perspective.

### Ambiguity and Contradictions

The term is notoriously nebulous. Various definitions have been proposed or are implicitly used:

* "All the music in the world": Too broad to be meaningful, though perhaps close to Brown's original ideal.
* Folk music from around the world: An early understanding.
* Music from non-English speaking countries: A common industry shorthand.
* Music combining Western popular styles (pop, rock) with non-Western genres: Acknowledges hybridity.
* "Local music from out there" / "Someone else's local music": Captures the sense of distance.
* **Definition by opposition:** Functionally, music defined against Western popular/art music; a catch-all for the "non-Western".

A significant contradiction lies in the term's frequent association with "traditional," "indigenous," or "roots" music, implying authenticity, yet the category explicitly includes contemporary popular music and fusion genres.

### Included Genres, Styles, and Artists

The scope is vast. Examples cited include:

* **Geographic Regions:** Music from Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, Nordic countries, Oceania, specific Western folk traditions.

* **Diverse Styles:** Tuvan throat singing, Zimbabwean guitar bands, Qawwali, Cajun fiddling, Hawaiian slack-key guitar, Indian classical (Hindustani, Carnatic - e.g., Ravi Shankar), West African drumming/kora, Gamelan, Chinese opera, Koto music, Tibetan chants, Balkan village music (e.g., The Mystery Of The Bulgarian Voices), Nordic folk, Salsa, Samba, Tango, Cumbia, Mambo, Bossa Nova, Merengue, Bachata, Reggaeton, Flamenco (e.g., Paco de Lucía), Tarab, Rai, etc.

* **Specific Genres:** Celtic music (e.g., Alan Stivell, Clannad, Enya), Afrobeat (Fela Kuti), Highlife, Reggae, Jùjú music, Mbaqanga (Ladysmith Black Mambazo).

* **Fusion Genres:** Worldbeat, World Fusion, Global Fusion, Ethnic Fusion (e.g., Afro-Celt Sound System, Ethio-jazz - Mulatu Astatke).

* **Associated Artists:** Peter Gabriel (Real World Records, WOMAD), David Byrne (Luaka Bop), Ry Cooder (Buena Vista Social Club), Youssou N'Dour, Angélique Kidjo, Manu Dibango, Hugh Masekela, Miriam Makeba, Zap Mama, Johnny Clegg, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, countless others.

The category's boundaries are defined more by excluding mainstream Anglo-American pop/rock and Western classical music than by internal coherence. This lack of unity fuels criticisms. 

Boundaries are porous; classification can depend inconsistently on perceived origin (e.g., Filipina pop singer vs. Swedish pop singer).

## Criticism and Controversy

The term has faced extensive criticism since its popularization.

### Ethnocentrism and Western Bias ("West vs. the Rest")

Critics argue "world music" is a Western category imposed on the rest of the globe, positioning Western music as the norm and all others as "Other." This reflects historical biases and the dominance of Western music industry structures. 

David Byrne noted it creates an "us vs. them" divide.

### Homogenization and Oversimplification

The term lumps together vastly different traditions, obscuring their unique cultural, historical, and musical specificities. This serves marketing convenience over accurate representation.

### Commercialization, Commodification, and Exploitation

Stemming from its marketing origins, the term prioritizes Western tastes and profit. Concerns exist about unfair compensation for non-Western artists and the packaging of cultural difference as a commodity, sometimes echoing colonial patterns.

### Exoticism and Othering

The label can frame non-Western music as strange or "exotic," hindering genuine engagement. David Byrne called it a "distancing mechanism." NPR's Anastasia Tsioulcas noted it "smacks of... cultural colonialism" and forces diverse styles under the label of "exotic Other."

### Authenticity Debates

The category often implies "authenticity" or "tradition," which is problematic:

* **Essentialism:** Risks presenting cultures as static.
* **Gatekeeping:** Empowers Westerners to define "authentic."
* **Stereotyping:** Pressures artists to conform to Western ideas of "traditional."
* **Ignoring Hybridity:** Struggles to value vital contemporary hybrid forms.

### Colonial Connotations

Critics argue the term echoes colonial practices through its "West vs. Rest" dichotomy, industry power imbalances, and the act of labeling diverse cultures from a dominant viewpoint. This influenced the Grammy renaming.

### Perspectives Summarized

* **Academics:** Focus on ethnocentrism, homogenization, commercial distortion, colonial links.
* **Artists:** Express frustration with the label but sometimes acknowledge past visibility benefits.
* **Industry/Critics:** Debate its utility vs. harm; some see it as outdated.

The core issue is imposing Western commercial logic onto diverse global musical realities.

## Evolving Terminology and Current Status

Moves exist to replace or refine the term.

### The Shift to "Global Music"

In 2020/2021, the Grammys renamed the category "Best Global Music Album" (and added "Best Global Music Performance") citing colonialism connotations and aiming for inclusivity.

### Critique of "Global Music"

Many see this as a superficial change that doesn't fix the core issue of homogenization. Some suggest it favors commercially successful, globally-influenced artists over more traditional styles. The limited number of categories remains contentious.

### Alternative Classifications and Approaches

* **Alternative Terms:** "International," "Folk," "Traditional," "Regional," "Indigenous," "World Beat," etc.
* **Specificity:** Using specific genre/regional labels is preferred.
* **Academic Frameworks:** Ethnomusicology uses detailed analysis; computational methods classify based on structure or style.

### The Role of Festivals and Institutions (e.g., WOMAD)

WOMAD continues under its original name, celebrating diversity while founders acknowledge ambiguity in the term "world music."

### Contemporary Relevance

Debate continues on whether umbrella terms are needed in the streaming age. Some argue online discovery makes them obsolete; others see value in highlighting marginalized music in Western markets. 

Despite criticism, the terms and the impulse to categorize persist.
