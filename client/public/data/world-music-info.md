# World Music (Term)

World music is a term used broadly to classify musical styles from diverse cultures across the globe, particularly those lying outside the mainstream Western popular music and Western art music traditions.

Originating independently in academic and music industry contexts during the latter half of the 20th century, the term has become both influential and highly contested. Its inherent ambiguity, coupled with its function as a marketing category, has led to significant criticism regarding its vague definition, commercial motivations, and perceived reinforcement of ethnocentrism, cultural homogenization, and exoticism. The term simultaneously operates as an academic concept with idealistic roots, a pragmatic tool for the music industry, and a focal point for critical cultural debate.

## Etymology and Origins

The term "world music" has distinct origins in academia and the commercial music industry, with significantly different initial intentions.

### Academic Coining: Robert E. Brown and Wesleyan University

The term is widely credited to American ethnomusicologist **Robert E. Brown**, who conceived it in the early 1960s at Wesleyan University in Connecticut. Brown was instrumental in developing a comprehensive music program at Wesleyan, offering studies from the undergraduate to the doctoral level.

Brown stated that his primary motivation for coining "world music" was to differentiate his new Ph.D. program from existing ethnomusicology programs. Ethnomusicology, which emerged formally around 1950 from comparative musicology, primarily focused on studying music within its cultural context, often using ethnographic methods. While ethnomusicology aimed to move beyond the Western biases of earlier comparative musicology, Brown envisioned a program with a strong performance orientation. The objective was to teach students to perform music from various global traditions as faithfully as possible. To facilitate this, Brown invited numerous visiting performers from Africa and Asia and initiated a world music concert series at Wesleyan.

Philosophically, Brown's concept of world music was idealistic, anticipating a future global culture where accelerated communication technology would allow all music to potentially belong to everyone. It aimed to view music from diverse cultures from a perspective "beyond culture," while simultaneously recognizing the critical need to preserve the vast diversity of human musical expression. This utopian vision, embodied in the Wesleyan World Music Program, created a vibrant musical environment in the 1960s and began to disseminate the term and the concept of "world music" to a wider public through musical events and performances. Brown's original concept, therefore, was focused on performance, preservation, and a future-oriented global musical landscape, rather than simply categorizing existing non-Western music for study or sale. This idealistic foundation contrasts sharply with the term's later adoption and redefinition by the music industry.

### Popularization as a Marketing Category

While Brown coined the term academically in the 1960s, "world music" gained widespread currency and its most recognized meaning in the 1980s as a marketing category devised by the Western music industry.

#### The 1980s Music Industry Context

The rise of "world music" as a commercial label was largely a response to specific market conditions in the 1980s. A pivotal moment was the release and international success of Paul Simon's album **Graceland** in 1986. The album, which prominently featured South African musicians and musical styles (including Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Savuka), significantly increased the interest of Western audiences in music from other parts of the world, particularly Africa. This success highlighted a growing market for non-Western sounds.

However, record labels and retailers faced a practical problem: how to categorize and display this diverse music. Genres like Nigerian jùjú, Ghanaian highlife, or Pakistani qawwali did not fit neatly into existing sections like "Pop," "Rock," "Jazz," or "Classical." Pre-existing terms like "International," "Ethnic," or "Folk" were considered insufficient, potentially confusing, or carried negative connotations. "International" had limited currency, often associated with tourist souvenirs or academic field recordings. There was a need for a unified, marketable term.

#### The 1987 London Meeting

To address this challenge and capitalize on the growing interest sparked by artists like Simon and the increasing visibility of African musicians like Fela Kuti, Manu Dibango, Hugh Masekela, and Miriam Makeba, a pivotal meeting was held in a London pub on **June 29, 1987**. Initiated by executives from independent record labels such as Roger Armstrong (Ace Records) and Ben Mandelson (GlobeStyle), and attended by key figures in the UK roots and international music scene, including fRoots magazine founder Ian Anderson, the meeting's primary objective was explicitly commercial. They sought an umbrella term to improve the marketing, distribution, and retail visibility of non-Western music.

Several names were suggested, including "world beat" (a term coined separately by DJ Dan Del Santo in Texas around 1983) and prefixing existing genres with words like "hot" or "tropical". Ultimately, **"World Music"** won after a show of hands. Crucially, the term was not initially intended to define a new musical genre itself, but rather to serve as a short-term marketing label for a specific campaign. The logic, articulated by Roger Armstrong, was to create a designated section—a "box" akin to "Jazz" or "Rock"—where retailers could confidently stock these otherwise hard-to-place releases, and where interested customers could browse or find music they might have heard on the radio.

#### Commercial Rollout and Institutionalization

Following the meeting, a coordinated marketing campaign was launched. This included designing distinctive two-color record sleeves with special offers and providing retailers with labels for shelf or rack edging to clearly mark the new "World Music" section. Leafleting campaigns and outreach to DJs, particularly outside London, were key strategies to build awareness and demand.

The term was rapidly adopted by the media and the broader music industry. Its status as a recognized category was solidified through institutionalization. In 1990, the influential US trade magazine **Billboard** introduced a World Music chart. A year later, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), the organization behind the Grammy Awards, added a category for **Best World Music Album**, first awarded in 1992. This pragmatic, market-driven adoption fundamentally shifted the term's meaning away from Robert Brown's academic and philosophical concept towards a retail category defined primarily by the needs and perspectives of the Western music industry. This shift laid the groundwork for many of the subsequent criticisms regarding commercialization, homogenization, and ethnocentrism.

## Definitions and Scope

A central challenge surrounding the term "world music" is its inherent ambiguity and the lack of a single, universally accepted definition. Its meaning has shifted over time and varies depending on context and perspective.

### Ambiguity and Contradictions

The term is notoriously nebulous. Various definitions have been proposed or are implicitly used:

* **"All the music in the world"**: While sometimes invoked, this definition is generally considered too broad to be meaningful. Robert Brown's original academic concept perhaps approached this ideal.
* **Folk music from around the world**: An early understanding associated with Brown's coining.
* **Music from non-English speaking countries**: A common shorthand used in the industry.
* **Music combining Western popular styles (pop, rock) with non-Western genres**: Acknowledges the hybridity common in the category.
* **"Local music from out there" / "Someone else's local music"**: Captures the sense of distance from the presumed Western listener.
* **Definition by opposition**: Functionally, music defined against Western popular music and Western art music; a catch-all for music not fitting established Western categories.

A significant contradiction lies in the term's frequent association with "traditional," "indigenous," or "roots" music, implying authenticity, yet the category explicitly includes contemporary popular music styles and fusion genres.

### Included Genres, Styles, and Artists

The scope of "world music" is vast, encompassing an enormous diversity of sounds:

* **Geographic Regions**: Music from Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, Nordic countries, Oceania, and specific folk traditions within Western countries.
* **Diverse Styles**: Tuvan throat singing, Zimbabwean guitar bands, Pakistani Qawwali, Cajun fiddlers, Hawaiian slack-key guitar, Indian classical (Ravi Shankar), West African drumming, Indonesian gamelan, Chinese opera, Japanese koto, Tibetan chants, Balkan village music (The Mystery Of The Bulgarian Voices), Nordic folk, Latin genres (Salsa, Samba, Tango, Cumbia, Bossa Nova, Reggaeton), Flamenco (Paco de Lucía), Arabic Tarab, North African Rai, etc.
* **Specific Genres**: Celtic music (Alan Stivell, Clannad, Enya), Afrobeat (Fela Kuti), Highlife, Reggae (sometimes included), Nigerian Jùjú, South African Mbaqanga (Ladysmith Black Mambazo).
* **Fusion Genres**: Worldbeat, World Fusion, Global Fusion, Ethnic Fusion. **Worldbeat** specifically denotes blends of Western pop/rock with world/traditional elements (e.g., Afro-Celt Sound System, Ethio-jazz like Mulatu Astatke).
* **Associated Artists**: Peter Gabriel (Real World Records, WOMAD), David Byrne (Luaka Bop), Ry Cooder (Buena Vista Social Club), Youssou N'Dour, Angélique Kidjo, Manu Dibango, Hugh Masekela, Miriam Makeba, Zap Mama, Johnny Clegg, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, and countless others.

Ultimately, the category's boundaries are defined more by **exclusion** (non-mainstream Anglo-American pop/rock, Western classical) than by internal musical coherence. This lack of unity, driven by its function as a catch-all for the "non-Western," fuels criticisms of homogenization and makes precise musical description problematic. Boundaries remain porous and market-dependent.

## Criticism and Controversy

The term "world music" has faced extensive criticism from academics, artists, critics, and industry insiders.

### Ethnocentrism and Western Bias ("West vs. the Rest")

A primary criticism is that "world music" is **inherently ethnocentric**, a Western category imposed on the rest of the globe. It defines non-Western music relative to Western pop/art music, positioning the West as the "norm" and everything else as "Other." This framework is reinforced by Western-dominated industry structures and echoes earlier biased terms like "ethnic" or "primitive" music. David Byrne highlighted this "us" vs. "them" divide.

### Homogenization and Oversimplification

The term lumps together vastly different traditions (e.g., Qawwali, Afrobeats, Japanese Koto) under one label, obscuring their unique cultural, historical, and musical specifics. This **oversimplification** serves marketing convenience over cultural understanding, treating diverse cultures as a monolithic entity.

### Commercialization, Commodification, and Exploitation

Originating from the 1987 marketing meeting, the term is criticized as primarily a tool for Western markets, prioritizing **marketability and profit** over cultural sensitivity or artistic integrity. Concerns include potential economic exploitation of non-Western artists and the packaging of cultural difference as a commodity. The narrative of Western artists "discovering" music can perpetuate colonial patterns.

### Exoticism and Othering

"World music" is accused of promoting **exoticism**, framing non-Western music as strange or foreign from a Western viewpoint. David Byrne called it a "distancing mechanism," making the music "cute, weird but safe" and hindering genuine engagement. Critics like Anastasia Tsioulcas noted it "smacks of cultural colonialism" and labels diverse styles as the "exotic Other," connecting to broader issues of Orientalism and problematic representations.

### Authenticity Debates

The category often implies **"authenticity"** or "tradition," which is criticized for:

* **Essentialism**: Presenting cultures as static, ignoring dynamism and hybridity.
* **Gatekeeping**: Empowering Western figures to define "authentic" non-Western music.
* **Stereotyping**: Pressuring artists to conform to Western ideas of "traditional" sounds.
* **Ignoring Hybridity**: Struggling to value blended forms vital to contemporary music.

David Byrne critiqued the Western obsession with authenticity and the myth of the "untutored savant."

### Colonial Connotations

Critics argue the term carries **connotations of colonialism** due to the historical context of Western categorization and exploitation of non-Western cultures. The "West vs. Rest" dichotomy, industry power imbalances, and defining global cultures from a Western viewpoint echo colonial practices. This was a factor in the Grammy category renaming.

### Perspectives Summarized

* **Academics/Ethnomusicologists**: Focus on theoretical weaknesses (ethnocentrism, homogenization, commercial distortion, colonial links). Many avoid or use the term critically.
* **Artists**: Often express frustration at being stereotyped and lumped together, though some acknowledge historical visibility gains. Most prefer just "music."
* **Industry/Critics**: Debate its utility versus harmful effects; some see it as outdated, others see a continued (problematic) need for categorization.

These criticisms are interconnected, stemming from the imposition of a simplistic, Western-centric commercial logic onto complex global musical realities.

## Evolving Terminology and Current Status

In response to criticism, terminology has evolved, though underlying issues often persist.

### The Shift to "Global Music"

In November 2020, the Recording Academy renamed the "Best World Music Album" Grammy category to **"Best Global Music Album"** (effective 2021), later adding "Best Global Music Performance." The stated rationale was to move away from a term with "connotations of colonialism" towards language that is "more relevant, modern, and inclusive."

### Critique of "Global Music"

The shift to "Global Music" is criticized by many as **merely semantic or superficial**, failing to address the core issue of grouping dissimilar genres based on non-Western origin. The "othering" effect and stereotypes are seen as continuing. Some suggest the new category might favor more commercially successful, internationally charting artists (like Afrobeats stars), potentially marginalizing more traditional styles. The adequacy of only a few categories for all non-Western music remains debated.

### Alternative Classifications and Approaches

Dissatisfaction fuels calls for alternatives:

* **Alternative Terms**: "Global Music," "International Music," "Folk Music," "Traditional Music," "Regional Music" (e.g., Latin, African), "Indigenous Music," "Ethnomusicology" (academic field), "World Beat." Each has nuances and potential issues.
* **Specificity**: Using more precise genre, regional, or cultural labels is widely advocated.
* **Academic/Analytical Frameworks**: Ethnomusicology uses detailed methods. Computational approaches analyze structural features (e.g., CantoCore) or cultural style via audio signals, aiming for objective analysis over market labels.

### The Role of Festivals and Institutions (e.g., WOMAD)

Institutions like the **WOMAD (World of Music, Arts and Dance)** festival, co-founded by Peter Gabriel in 1982, navigate these debates. WOMAD aims to celebrate global diversity and foster collaboration. Co-founder Thomas Brooman acknowledged marketing needs but expressed uncertainty about the term's meaning. Despite critiques, WOMAD retains its name and remains a major platform.

### Contemporary Relevance

The relevance of broad categories is debated in the digital age. Streaming allows easier discovery of specifics, potentially making umbrella terms obsolete. However, some argue categorization remains useful for highlighting marginalized music in dominant Western markets. Despite criticism and shifts like "Global Music," the terms and the impulse to categorize persist, reflecting ongoing tensions between commerce, cultural representation, and listening habits in a globalized world.
